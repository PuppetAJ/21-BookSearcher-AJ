## Description

This is Adrian Jimenez's module 21 MERN stack Book Searcher challenge submission. 

This project is a MERN stack book searcher application that allows the user to fetch books from the google books api, and display them onto a page. It features authentication which the user can use to sign up or log in, and if they are logged in, they are able to save books to a mongoDB database using GraphQL. They can later view these books on their saved books page and edit the list if necessary.
